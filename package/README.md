# üåü Azure MCP Server

The Azure MCP Server implements the [MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) to create a seamless connection between AI agents and Azure services.  Azure MCP Server can be used alone or with the [GitHub Copilot for Azure extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azure-github-copilot) in VS Code.  This project is in Public Preview and implementation may significantly change prior to our General Availability.

Here's a short (16 seconds) video to help you get the Azure MCP Server installed in VS Code.

### ‚öôÔ∏è VS Code Install Steps (Recommended)
1. Install either the stable or Insiders release of VS Code:
   * [üí´ Stable release](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
   * [üîÆ Insiders release](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders)
2. Install the [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) and [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) extensions
3. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) 20 or later
   * Ensure `node` and `npm` are in your path
4. Open VS Code in an empty folder
5. Install any of the available Azure MCP Server(s) for either the stable or Insiders release of VS Code
6. Open GitHub Copilot in VS Code and [switch to Agent mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode)
7. Click `refresh` on the tools list.

## üîÑÔ∏è Upgrading Existing Installs to the Latest Version

<details>
<summary>How to stay current with releases of Azure MCP Server</summary>

#### NPX

If you use the default package spec of `@azure/mcp@latest`, npx will look for a new version on each server start. If you use just `@azure/mcp`, npx will continue to use its cached version until its cache is cleared.

#### NPM

If you globally install the cli via `npm install -g @azure/mcp` it will use the installed version until you manually update it with `npm update -g @azure/mcp`.

#### Docker

There is no version update built into the docker image.  To update, just pull the latest from the repo and repeat the [docker installation instructions](#docker-install).

#### VS Code

Installation in VS Code should be in one of the previous forms and the update instructions are the same. If you installed the mcp server with the `npx` command and  `-y @azure/mcp@latest` args, npx will check for package updates each time VS Code starts the server. Using a docker container in VS Code has the same no-update limitation described above.
</details>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Install Scenarios (Optional)
<details>
<summary>Docker containers, custom MCP clients, and manual install options</summary>

#### üêã Docker Install Steps (Optional)
For a step-by-step Docker installation, follow these instructions:

1. Clone repository
2. From repository root, build Docker image: `docker build -t azure/azuremcp .`
3. Create an `.env` file with environment variables that [match one of the `EnvironmentCredential`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.identity.environmentcredential) sets.  For example, a `.env` file using a service principal could look like:
```json
AZURE_TENANT_ID={YOUR_AZURE_TENANT_ID}
AZURE_CLIENT_ID={YOUR_AZURE_CLIENT_ID}
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET={YOUR_AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET}
```
4. Add `.vscode/mcp.json` or update existing MCP configuration. Replace `/full/path/to/.env` with a path to your `.env` file.
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "Azure MCP Server": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "--env-file",
        "/full/path/to/.env"
        "azure/azuremcp",
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Optionally, customers can use `--env` or `--volume` to pass authentication values.

#### ü§ñ Custom MCP Client Install Steps (Optional)
You can easily configure your MCP client to use the Azure MCP Server. Have your client run the following command and access it via standard IO or SSE.

#### üîß Manual Install Steps (Optional)
For a step-by-step installation, follow these instructions:

1. Add `.vscode/mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "Azure MCP Server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@azure/mcp@latest",
        "server",
        "start"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

You can optionally set the `--service <service>` flag to install tools for the specified Azure product or service.

1. Add `.vscode/mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "Azure Best Practices": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@azure/mcp@latest",
        "server",
        "start",
        "--service",
        "bestpractices" // Any of the available MCP servers can be referenced here.
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Using standard IO

Configure the MCP client to execute: `npx -y @azure/mcp@latest server start`. For instructions on using , follow instructions in [Quick install with VS Code](#-quick-install-with-vs-code) or [Manual Install](#-manual-install).

### Using SSE

1. Open a terminal window and execute: `npx -y @azure/mcp@latest server start --transport sse`
2. The server starts up and is hosted at: http://localhost:5008.  To use another port, append `--port {YOUR-PORT-NUMBER}`.
3. Open your MCP client and add the SSE configuration value.  This may differ between MCP clients.  In VS Code, it will look like:
   ```json
   {
      "servers": {
        "Azure MCP Server": {
          "type": "sse",
          "url": "http://localhost:5008/sse"
        }
      }
    }
   ```

## üìù Troubleshooting

See [Troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-mcp/blob/main/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for help with common issues and logging.

### üîë Authentication

<details>
<summary>We use Azure Identity SDK under the hood via DefaultAzureCredential, which tries these credentials in order:</summary>

The Azure MCP Server seamlessly integrates with your host operating system's authentication mechanisms, making it super easy to get started! We use Azure Identity under the hood via [`DefaultAzureCredential`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/azure/sdk/authentication/credential-chains?tabs=dac), which tries these credentials in order:

1. **Environment Variables** (`EnvironmentCredential`) - Perfect for CI/CD pipelines
2. **Shared Token Cache** (`SharedTokenCacheCredential`) - Uses cached tokens from other tools
3. **Visual Studio** (`VisualStudioCredential`) - Uses your Visual Studio credentials
4. **Azure CLI** (`AzureCliCredential`) - Uses your existing Azure CLI login
5. **Azure PowerShell** (`AzurePowerShellCredential`) - Uses your Az PowerShell login
6. **Azure Developer CLI** (`AzureDeveloperCliCredential`) - Uses your azd login
7. **Interactive Browser** (`InteractiveBrowserCredential`) - Falls back to browser-based login if needed

If you're already logged in through any of these methods, the Azure MCP Server will automatically use those credentials. Ensure that you have the correct authorization permissions in Azure (e.g. read access to your Storage account) via RBAC (Role-Based Access Control). To learn more about Azure's RBAC authorization system, visit this [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview).

If you're running into any issues with authentication, visit our [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-mcp/blob/main/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

### Production Credentials

By default, the Azure MCP Server excludes production credentials like Managed Identity and Workload Identity. To enable these credentials, set the environment variable:

```
AZURE_MCP_INCLUDE_PRODUCTION_CREDENTIALS=true
```

This is useful when running on Azure services where you want to use managed identities.
</details>

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Note

Your credentials are always handled securely through the official [Azure Identity SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/identity/Azure.Identity/README.md) - **we never store or manage tokens directly**.

MCP as a phenomenon is very novel and cutting-edge. As with all new technology standards, consider doing a security review to ensure any systems that integrate with MCP servers follow all regulations and standards your system is expected to adhere to. This includes not only the Azure MCP Server, but any MCP client/agent that you choose to implement down to the model provider.
